# Development Code challenge!

Welcome to Datenworks front end code challenge, here you will have some instructions of what you have to do.

## About the Challenge

You have to create a boilerplate with libraries and extensions that will help you develop the app. This boilerplate can be made in any tech you want to, but we prefer you to do this using ReactJS.

You have to consider ECMA, unit test, code smell and a good file structure modeling. A good state management is required too, so your project don't become a monster.

### Requirements:

* Write a documentation to explain how to execute it;
* Create at least one page consuming the [StarWars API](https://swapi.co/);

## Evaluation Method

Your code will be under review by the Datenworks Engineering team.

What we will consider on this evaluation:
- **Performance**
- **Unit Tests**
- **Isolation of responsibilities**
- **Software Engineering concerns (cohesion, reusability, etc)**

Feel free to implement it the way you feel more confortable :)

GOOD LUCK!
